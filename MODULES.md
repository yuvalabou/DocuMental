1. The Monitor Module
This is the core of the project. It's a Python script that only does one thing: it watches the printer queue and detects changes. It doesn't talk to the LLM or send notifications. It simply logs or prints out what's happening.

Key Functionality:

Initialize a connection to the printer using pywin32.

Run an infinite loop.

Inside the loop, get the current state of all jobs in the queue.

Compare the current state to the last known state.

If there are new jobs, jobs with changed statuses (e.g., from SPOOLING to ERROR), or jobs that have been completed, print a clean, structured message about the change to the console.

Sleep for a few seconds before the next check.

Expected Output: Simple text like "Job ID 123: New job, 'Resume.pdf'" or "Job ID 124: Status change to 'ERROR' - Paper Jam".

2. The Brain Module
This module takes the structured event from the monitor and turns it into a human-readable message.

Key Functionality:

A function that accepts a string representing the event (e.g., "Job ID 124: Status change to 'ERROR' - Paper Jam").

This function constructs a prompt for the local LLM.

It sends the prompt to your local Ollama server.

It returns the LLM's response as a simple string.

Input/Output: A simple function call like get_llm_response("Job ID 124: Status change to 'ERROR' - Paper Jam") that returns something like "Looks like John's resume is stuck. The printer is reporting a paper jam."

3. The Communication Module
This module handles the final output. It's a simple, single-purpose function.

Key Functionality:

A function that accepts a title and a message.

It uses plyer to display a desktop notification.

Input: A function call like notify_user("Printer Alert", "Looks like John's resume is stuck...").

Putting It All Together
Your main script will import these three modules. The main loop will call the Monitor Module. When an event is detected, it passes the information to the Brain Module to generate a message. Finally, it passes that message to the Communication Module to display the notification.

This modular approach makes the project far more manageable. You can focus on getting the pywin32 part right first, without worrying about the LLM. Once that's solid, you can tackle the LLM integration. This is the correct way to approach a project with limited skillsâ€”conquer it in bite-sized, testable chunks.
