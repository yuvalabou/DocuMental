That's a good move. A solid README is a must. Here's one, clean and to the point.

# DocuMental: An Intelligent Printer Agent

Prt-Mind is a Windows-based printer agent that gives your printer a voice. Using a local "nano" LLM, it monitors your print queue and translates technical error codes and status updates into concise, human-friendly desktop notifications. The entire system is local, private, and fast.

## Features

  * **Queue Monitoring:** Watches the Windows Print Spooler for new jobs, status changes, and errors.
  * **Intelligent Alerts:** Uses a local LLM to turn cryptic printer errors (like "PAPER\_JAM") into simple, actionable messages.
  * **Local & Private:** The LLM runs on your machine using Ollama, ensuring your print job details never leave your network.
  * **Desktop Notifications:** Delivers alerts directly to your desktop, no extra software needed beyond the script's dependencies.
  * **Modular Design:** Built with a clean separation of concerns, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Requirements

  * **Windows OS:** This project relies on the Windows Print Spooler and Win32 APIs.
  * **Python 3.x:** The core script is written in Python.
  * **Ollama:** A local LLM server to run the AI model. You'll need to install it and download a compact model like `phi-3-mini`.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Python:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed and configured on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** From your terminal, install the required Python libraries.
    ```
    pip install pywin32 plyer requests
    ```
3.  **Set up Ollama:**
      * Download and install **Ollama** for Windows.
      * From your terminal, pull a small, fast model. For example:
        ```
        ollama pull phi-3-mini
        ```
      * Ensure Ollama is running in the background.
4.  **Configure:**
      * Copy the `prt_mind.py` script to a directory of your choice.
      * Open the script and configure your printer's name. You can find this in your Windows printer settings.
5.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```
    python prt_mind.py
    ```

The script will begin monitoring your printer queue. When a print job's status changes or an error occurs, you'll receive a desktop notification with a message generated by the LLM.

## How It Works

  * **Monitor:** The `pywin32` library polls the Windows Print Spooler.
  * **Translate:** An event is detected, and a prompt is sent to the local Ollama server running the LLM.
  * **Notify:** The LLM's response is delivered as a desktop notification using `plyer`.

## Extending Prt-Mind

The modular design makes it easy to add new features.

  * **Different LLM Model:** Swap out the `phi-3-mini` model in your code for another one (e.g., `llama3`) to change the tone or intelligence.
  * **Alternative Notifications:** Modify the `notify_user` function to send alerts to a different service, like email or a messaging app.
